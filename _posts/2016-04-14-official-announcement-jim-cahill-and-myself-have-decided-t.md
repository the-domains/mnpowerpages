Official Announcement: Jim Cahill and myself have decided to discontinue the Senior Powerlifting Championships. We wanted to create something unique for Powerlifters to shoot for and that goal was accomplished. Seeing the excitement of lifters climbing the latter for higher level of competition was the best thing to be part of. However we ran into some roadblocks that made continuing the meet impractical. First the USAPL moved Raw Nationals to the fall which drew away a large amount of those who would have competed at our contest. The other was the time of the year and family conflicts. These two factors are the main reasons why we made this decision.  But I can promise you that the two biggest events in Minnesota will continue on. We are working on getting the 2016 Twin Cities Open up and rolling and will have that information posted in the near future. Thank you all who supported the Senior Powerlifting Event.

The start of 2016 has begun regretfully on a low note. The collective Powerlifting family has lost two of its own over the past few days.

**Dean Bennett**

A long time competitor, Member of Atomic Fitness and frequent volunteer for the Relentless contests passed away while driving home.

**Joel Ford**

A long time competitor with the USAPL, holder of state records and father of a number of kids passed yesterday after fighting an aggressive form of cancer.

Our prayers condolences and best wishes for their friends and family. And we are thankful to have known them.
